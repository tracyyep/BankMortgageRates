I use Angular js, CSS, bootstrap.css html in this one
Just download the zip file, put it in your htdocs directory.
and navigate to open the :
1. index-mortgage.html
2. index-mortgageview.html

There are two different html views in this one zip file : 
1. Using the index-mortgage.html - You can sort by click on the column header 
2. Using the index-mortgageview.html - You can see different view by selecting view.
